  std::set::insert
    returns std::pair<iterator, bool>
  std::priority_queue:
    - std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> for min heap implementation
    - top(), push(), pop()
    - lambda can be passed in constructor for comparision. 



Points to remember
******************
  - finding two swapped elements in almost sorted array.
      - firstElement is greater than the next element and occurs leftmost.
      - secondElement is less than the prev element and occurs rightmost.
   
  - Topological Ordering:
      - for directed acyclic graph
      - ordering such that if there is path from a to b then a occurs before b in the ordering.
   
  - Disjoint intervals/ranges
      - ordered set i.e std::set<std::pair<int,int>> as an alternative to segment tree
      - insertion O(logn) : may trigger merge
      - find O(logn)
      - deletion O(logn)
      - A given range can have following overlapping with existing ranges.
          - left overlapping, right overlapping, containing overlapping, contained overlapping
      - eg: data-stream-as-disjoint-intervals, range-module
      - imp: range_query.cc    

  - spiral maxtrix
      - minRow, maxRow, minCol, maxCol
      - avoid overlap
  - slow ptr vs fastPtr approach 
      - used for cycle detection in linked list 
      - relative distance between them decreases by 1 after each step once both enter the cycle.
