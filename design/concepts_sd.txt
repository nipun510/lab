synchronous communication
  - request/response
  - RPC and REST
asynchronous communication
  - event based
  - choreography
  - loose coupling, more scalable


RPC
  - Java RMI, SOAP, Trift, gRPC
  - Terms: Marsheling, Unmarshelling, server stub, client stub
  upsides:
    - ease of use
  downsides:
    - Technology coupling eg Java RMI
    - cost associated with remote calls which get mixed with local locals.
    - change in interface requires Server as well as client stub deployment.


REST : REpresentational State Transfer
  - architectural style inspired by web
  - noun specifies resource and verbs specify operation on them.
  - communication must be stateless and cacheable.
  - specified no underlying protocol but HTTP 1.1 mostly used
  - HATEOS : Hypermedia as the engine of application state
      - representation of resource contains links to other related resources.     - Clients navigate them and discovers new resources and operations.
      - Decreased coupling between client and server.

  Downsides:
    - not well suited for low latency.

Domain name system:
  - domain name => ip address
  - managed DNS service like CloudFare, Route 53
      - Weighed Round robing
      - Latency based
      - geolocation based

Content delivery network:
  - closer to user, reduced RTT
  - needs redirection.
  - cloudFront
  - push CDNs
      - more storage, less traffic
      - suited for sites with less traffic
  - pull CDNs
      - less storage, more traffic
      - time-to-live TTL
    
Versioning:
  - semantic versioning : MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  - Tolerant reader, Consumer driven contract.
  - expand and contract pattern.
  - For HTTP, Putting version number in request header and also in URI itself.
  - For gRPC, putting methods in new namespace.
  

Client library:
  - useful for service discovery, failure mode, logging etc
  - client should be responsible for maintenance and upgrade
  - may led to Increased coupling between client and server


Monitoring:
  - metrics vs log
  - metric tracking:
      - prometheus,
      - graphite
  - metrics : response time, error rate, system metrics
  - semantic monitoring
  - correlation IDs
  - all log information must be collected on a central server.
  - better to log in a standard json format.    
  - logging Tools 
      - logstash: can parse log data and send it to the search server as JSON
      - Kibana : UI for visualizing, searchin and analyzing the data.
      - logstash => elastic search => Kibana        
      
Testing:
  - Unit Testing
  - service Testing
  - end-to-end Testing
  - Consumer driven contracts
  - Canary releasing
  - Mean time to repair over mean time between failures.


Numbers to remember:
  - Availability:
      - 99.99% or four 9s : 8.6s
      - 99.9% or three 9s : 1m 26s
  - Main memory reference: 100ns
  - HDD = 30X SSD = 120X memory
  - Sequential read:
      - HDD: 30 MB/s
      - SDD: 1 GB/s
      - Main memory: 4 GB/s
