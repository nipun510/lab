Theory of computation:
  - grammar:
      - set of production rules
      - used to generate strings of a language
      - G : S -> aSb | E
      - L(G) = {a^nb^n, n >= 0) 

  - Chomsky classification:
     - Type0 or unrestricted grammar 
         - @ (V+T)*V(V+T)*  
         - B is (V+T)*
         - accepted by Turing machine
     - Type1 or context sensitive grammar
         - |@| <= |B| 
         - accepeted by linear bound automata
     - Type2 or context free grammar
         - |@|  = 1
         - accepeted by push down automata
     - Type3 or regular grammar
         - Restricted regular V -> VT / T or V -> TV/T
         - Extended regular   V -> VT* / T* or V -> T*V/T*
         - accepted by finite state automata

  

Cryptography:
  Hash function:
    - fixed length output
    - efficiency
    - deterministic
  
  cryptographic hash function:
  - pre-image resistance
  - second pre-image resistance
  - collision resistance

Uses:
  - document integrity
  - password storage
  - unique id
  - proof of work
